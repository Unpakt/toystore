{"name":"Toystore","body":"## Install\r\n\r\n```\r\ngem install toystore\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\n\r\nToystore is built on top of [Active Model](https://github.com/rails/rails/tree/master/activemodel) and [Adapter](http://jnunemaker.github.com/adapter/) ([wiki](https://github.com/jnunemaker/adapter/wiki)). Adapter is a simple gem for adapting a particular client to one simple API (similar to Ruby's hash API). Adapter actually ships with a memory adapter, which is used by default in Toystore. You can also define it yourself like this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrequire 'adapter/memory'\r\nrequire 'toystore'\r\n\r\nclass User\r\n  include Toy::Store\r\n  adapter :memory, {}\r\n\r\n  attribute :name, String\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimply include Toy::Store and then declare where you would like to store your data by passing the adapter name and an the client to the store method. From there you can declare your attributes and do anything else you want. There are [several examples](https://github.com/jnunemaker/toystore/tree/master/examples) included with the source.\r\n\r\nIf you change your mind and would like to store your data in Mongo, instead of just in memory, you can simply change the adapter:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nrequire 'adapter/mongo'\r\nrequire 'toystore'\r\n\r\nclass User\r\n  include Toy::Store\r\n  adapter :mongo, Mongo::Connection.new.db('adapter')['testing']\r\n\r\n  attribute :name, String\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n## ToyStore Power User Guides\r\n\r\n* [Wiki Home](https://github.com/jnunemaker/toystore/wiki)\r\n* [Identity](https://github.com/jnunemaker/toystore/wiki/Identity)\r\n* [Types](https://github.com/jnunemaker/toystore/wiki/Types)\r\n* [Exceptions](https://github.com/jnunemaker/toystore/wiki/Exceptions)\r\n\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\nAs of 0.8.3, I started keeping a [changelog](https://github.com/jnunemaker/toystore/blob/master/Changelog.md). All significant updates will be summarized there.\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\n\r\n* Rails 3, Sinatra, etc. No Rails 2 (because it uses Active Model).\r\n* Ruby 1.8.7, 1.9.2, 1.9.3 (specs are run against each before releases)\r\n\r\n## Mailing List\r\n\r\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/toystoreadapter\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\n* Fork the project.\r\n* Make your feature addition or bug fix in a topic branch.\r\n* Add tests for it. This is important so we don't break it in a future version unintentionally.\r\n* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or changelog. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine, but bump version in a commit by itself so we can ignore when we pull)\r\n* Send a pull request.\r\n","tagline":"An object mapper for anything that can read, write and delete data.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
