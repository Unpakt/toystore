## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix in a topic branch.
* Add tests for it. This is important so we don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or changelog. (if you want to have your own version, that is fine, but bump version in a commit by itself so we can ignore when we pull)
* Send a pull request.
